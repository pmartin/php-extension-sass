Library libsass sources: https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass
/!\ Doesn't compile to a shared library; only a static one.

C program that uses the static library: https://github.com/hcatlin/sassc
=> Could be considered as a base to build upon


Compiling the (static) libsass library:
TODO: use a git submodule, instead of "manually" cloning

    cd $HOME/developpement
    git clone https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass.git
    make
    #  => this creates the libsass.a static library


Configuring and compiling the extension:

    $HOME/bin/php-5.3-debug/bin/phpize
    ./configure --with-sass=/home/squale/developpement/libsass \
        --with-php-config=$HOME/bin/php-5.3-debug/bin/php-config
    make
    $HOME/bin/php-5.3-debug/bin/php -dextension=modules/sass.so -f ./test.php


Executing the tests:

    export NO_INTERACTION=1
    make test
